#STAT418 Final Project
This is the final project for Cole Sanders for STAT 418 at UCLA. This project involves gathering data from the Politics Subreddit to perform text analysis on. The end result will be a shinny program to estimate the effectivenes of different websites and title names on the Politics Subreddit.

##Proposal 
1. Pull data form the Politics Subreddit from both the Top and Controversial categories
2. Tokenize Text in Title and URL to look for common phrases
3. Build a model to show what combination of phrases, words, and websites are associated with higher scores and are more likely to appear in Top or Controversial
4. Build a Shiny Dashboard to help visualize the data and allow people to predict outcomes of using certain word and urls in a title
