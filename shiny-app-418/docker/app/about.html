    <h2>About this app</h2>
    </center>

    <p>This app looks at the top 25,000 post in the Politics subreddit on Reddit and allows you to compare phrases to see the average score they recieve.</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>We uses a seperate process to json query Reddit's public API to collect titles and scores for the top submission on the politics subreddit. We use this process to collect, structure, and save the data. We then uses this data in our shinny app to allow users to compare different phrases to uses in their titles. A histogram overlaying the distribution of scores is shown for both.<p>

    <h3>P values </h3>
    <p> In the top left corner a P-value is shown to allow you to gauge the statistical significance of the difference. Bellow the graph estimates and confidnce intervals are given. </p>
